        My name is Ryan Tolentino. I am 24 years old and was born and raised in the 
        Bay Area. I currently work full-time as a security officer at Cruise, an 
        autonomous vehicle company in San Francisco. I started working when I was
        13 years old, cutting hair out of my mother's garage. I graduated high
        school in 2016 with no plans of going to college. I planned on going to barber
        school when I saved up enough money, but that changed when COVID hit.
        Early in 2021 was when I decided to go to school to pursue a computer science
        degree. I am currently in my 3rd semester of college, and I am dual-enrolled
        at Skyline College and Diablo Valley College. In my free time, I like to 
        play guitar, go to the gym, watch basketball, and box.

    <p>I am attending this class because I want to learn how to build mobile and web
        applications. I am hoping the learn the fundamentals of writing good front-end 
        code. I eventually want to become a full stack developer. 
        My dream job would be to be in the music technology industry and develop
        virtual instruments. I also want to know how to develop my own web applications
        for when I start my personal brand.
